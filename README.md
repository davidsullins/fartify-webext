# Fartify

This Firefox web extension turns Slack apologies into farts. Specifically, on *.slack.com the word "sorry" is replaced with "farting" by pressing the fart icon next to the address bar.

This code was based on the Cloud To Butt Plus WebExtension from Andrei Petcu, which was in turn based on Cloud To Butt from Steven Frank.
